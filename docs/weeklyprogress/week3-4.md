# Week 3 & 4
June 27 - July 10

- Final Exams - No Code
- These two weeks I had my semester exams, most of the work is scheduled in the second half of the coding period. I couldn't work during the exams. I planned to compensate for this by putting extra hours in the remaining period.

- At least three packages updated/packaged.
      
      Bela, bb.org-overlays, ti-linux-kernel-4.14-r143
