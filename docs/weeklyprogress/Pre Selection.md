- I came across the BeagleBoard project for this yearâ€™s Google Summer of Code and found the project titled **Building Bela Images** quite interesting to me and i checked [BeagleBoard/GSoC/Ideas-2022 wiki](https://elinux.org/BeagleBoard/GSoC/Ideas-2022) to find are there any initial application tasks to do anything related to Building Bela Image and asked in beagleboard-gsoc slack channel to provide me with some small tasks related to the project to do.
- Got in touch with Giulio Moro and Dhruva Gole, started looking at [Bela Platform](https://github.com/BelaPlatform) projects and tried to understand the sprit behind these debian based distributions (bela, beagleboard images) and listed out features, somehow got familiar with code base.
- Setuped build environment on my machine to rebuild bela, beagleboard images and I tried some ways to boot Images using QEMU emulator and that didn't worked out as I don't have hardware to test the image. 
- I acquainted myself with [BeagleBoard.org](https://beagleboard.org/) and [BELA](https://bela.io/) and on what projects currently the community working and the products they both built till then.
- Drafted my [proposal](https://elinux.org/BeagleBoard/GSoC/2022_Proposal/Building_Bela_Images) and asked for suggestion and feedback from Guiliomoro and Dhruva Goel.
- After, feedback I updated my proposal with necessary corrections and necessary topics to work on as mentioned and submitted proposal on GSoC website.
