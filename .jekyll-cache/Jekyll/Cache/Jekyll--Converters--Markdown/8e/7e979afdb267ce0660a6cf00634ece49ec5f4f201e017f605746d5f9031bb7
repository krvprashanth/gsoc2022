<p>July 18 - July 24</p>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>Placed order for USB to TTL Serial Cable -UART connection to debug boot process.</li>
  <li>Had weekly meeting with Giulio Moro on  Monday, 20 June, 4:30 pm CEST ( 8:00 IST ) and for minutes of meet <a href="">check here</a></li>
  <li>Flash and booted the bela-stretch image which built in lask week and couldn‚Äôt test the image with examlpe sintone working and as per mentor suggestion started building latest bullseye image for bela.</li>
  <li>Initially, when i tried with the all Bela required packages that were in packages.txt of bela-image-builder and the build getting failed at the point resolving packages and none of the packages weren‚Äôt able to install via debootstrap. Tried with including bela-image-builder parameters for debootstrap in omap-image-builder scripts though it showed same error.</li>
  <li>Much time was spent on debootstrap trying to figure where it‚Äôs coming from and it fixed with Robert Nelson help.</li>
  <li>Solution: There‚Äôs a <a href="https://github.com/RobertCNelson/omap-image-builder/blob/master/scripts/debootstrap.sh#L41-L54">sed script</a> that reads *.conf file, it‚Äôs currently only knows about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;tabs&gt;</code> but yeah, it was always tabs and it‚Äôs more about more than one space <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sed 's/ /,/g'</code></li>
  <li>bela.io-debian-bullseye-v4.14-ti-xenomai-armhf build completes all the way and ready for boot testing and figured out what packages broke and then moved that packages under ‚Äúdeb_addition_pkgs‚Äù in bela-bullseye conf file.</li>
  <li>Studied about <a href="https://live-team.pages.debian.net/live-manual/html/live-manual/customizing-contents.en.html">Debian Live Manual/Customizing Contents</a></li>
  <li>Experimented on different ideas that which is suitable method for cross-compiling  xenomai-3 for Bela with omap-image-builder including in /target/chroot script or chroot_before_hook in /configs bela-bullseye file.</li>
  <li>Updated the target/chroot script (bela.io-bullseye.sh) with installation scripts to repos that bela ships and removed the ones that were not required for bela.
