    "content": ". | ARM Cross-Compilation on Debian x86 Machine | Find SD card device name | . Quick-wiki: ARM Cross-Compilation on Debian x86 Machine . The latest versions of DebianDebian has excellent support for cross-building through Debian Cross-toolchains ( see wiki: https://wiki.debian.org/ToolChain/Cross ). Toolchains are set of software development tools and libraries (such as gcc , gdb , glibc ) that are chained together to enable you to build executable code on one operating system on one type of machine, such as a 64-bit Linux OS on an Intel x86 machine, but to execute them on a different operating system and/or a different architecture, such as a 32-bit Linux OS on an ARM device. Debian cross toolchain is a good starting point. We can list the available toolchains as follows: . prashanth@krv:~$ apt-cache search cross-build-essential crossbuild-essential-amd64 - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-arm64 - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-armel - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-armhf - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-i386 - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-powerpc - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-ppc64el - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-s390x - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-mips - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-mips64 - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-mips64el - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-mips64r6 - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-mips64r6el - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-mipsel - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-mipsr6 - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-mipsr6el - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages . The main purpose of these packages is to allow cross-compiling of Linux programs for different architecture distributions, but these can be used also for bare metal programming. One thing to be aware is the fact that the compiler by default tries to link the Linux standard C libraries that in bare metal programming have no use. Here, I’m using ARM hard float ( armhf ) package for writing programs that is deployed to the Beagle boards. prashanth@krv:~$ sudo apt install crossbuild-essential-armhf Preparing to unpack .../crossbuild-essential-armhf_12.9_all.deb ... Unpacking crossbuild-essential-armhf (12.9) ... Setting up crossbuild-essential-armhf (12.9) ... Test installation by calling the compiler directly. prashanth@krv:~$ arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++ -v COLLECT_GCC=arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++ Thread model: posix gcc version 10.2.1 20210110 (Debian 10.2.1-6) . I’m writing a short C++ program, testcross.cpp , which can be compiled into binary code using the cross-compiler. prashanth@krv:~$ gedit testcross.cpp prashanth@krv:~$ more testcross.cpp #include&lt;iostream&gt; using namespace std; int main(){ cout &lt;&lt; \"Testing cross compilation for armhf\" &lt;&lt; endl; return 0; } prashanth@krv:~$ arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++ testcross.cpp -o testcross prashanth@krv:~$ ls -l testcross* -rwxr-xr-x 1 prashanth prashanth 9064 Apr 5 13:02 testcross -rw-r--r-- 1 prashanth prashanth 119 Apr 5 13:00 testcross.cpp . The binary file has an executable flag, but when the binary is invoked, it fails to execute. This is unsurprising, as we are attempting to execute ARM binary instructions on an Intel x86 machine. prashanth@krv:~$ ./testcross arm-binfmt-P: Could not open '/lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3': No such file or directory . This error indicates that the ld-linux-armhf.so.3 file is not in the system library directory. A search of the filesystem locates it in the /usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf/lib/ directory. prashanth@krv:~$ stat /usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf/lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3 File: /usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf/lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3 -&gt; ld-2.31.so Size: 10 Blocks: 0 IO Block: 4096 symbolic link Device: b302h/45826d Inode: 1447823 Links: 1 Access: (0777/lrwxrwxrwx) Uid: ( 0/ root) Gid: ( 0/ root) Access: 2022-04-05 13:02:21.727259593 +0530 Modify: 2021-03-03 17:24:20.000000000 +0530 Change: 2022-03-29 20:49:01.659052574 +0530 Birth: 2022-03-29 20:49:01.631052872 +0530 . One approach to solve this issue is to explicitly call the QEMU tool and specify the library directory, whereupon the program is emulated correctly. prashanth@krv:~$ qemu-arm-static -L /usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf/ testcross Testing cross compilation for armhf . Success! If we see this output, then we are able to build a binary on the x86 machine that can be executed directly on the ARM machine. Find SD card device name . The SD card is an essential part of the Embedded Linux Systems. It’s often necessary to copy(or “flash”) the software from our machine to an SD card for use in Embedded Linux System, or to back up projects ot the entire contents of SD card. This guide is about to find the SD card’s device name! choosing the wrong drive will likely result in data loss or even worse harm to our machine. My machine has an Integrated SD card reader and it is connected by a multiport USB unit and will be presented as /dev/sdx, where X is a single letter. The first hard drive is often /dev/sda. In most of the machines with SD card slots, this wiil be often be /dev/mmcblk0. I find the following method to be handy and simple: . Step1: Open a terminal . Step2: Get the list of existing devices in our system into a temporary file (say, /tmp/before_sd): . prashanth@krv:~$ ls /dev &gt; /tmp/before_sd . Step3: Insert SD card (be it via an external reader or directly to the SD port of your computer) . Step4: Get again the list of devices into a second temporary file (say, /tmp/after_sd): . prashanth@krv:~$ ls /dev &gt; /tmp/after_sd . Step5: Compare them . prashanth@krv:~$ diff /tmp/before_sd /tmp/after_sd 36a37,39 &gt; mmcblk0 &gt; mmcblk0p1 &gt; mmcblk0p2 . Or, if the device follows sdX, it would be: . prashanth@krv:~$ diff /tmp/before_sd /tmp/after_sd 55a57,59 &gt; sda &gt; sda1 . Note: The topmost name we received - In my case, sda. That’s the device we want to write to! (the other devices will point to partitions within the media we inserted). ",

The Bela Image development repo is heavily based and which was initially inspired by Beagleboard Image-builder scripts. Currently, the Beagle board Image development repo diverged greatly from a common functionalities of building Images. There is a requirement to “rebase” the functionalities of the Bela Image builder repo to the Beagleboard Image builder one. As the two codebases are drastically different we need to understand and “semantic rebase” the features of the Bela Image builder repo (xenomai kernel building scripts along with a bunch of other stuff) to Beagleboard Image builder repo. After these changes the Bela Image development will follow more closely with the Beagleboard Image development and as a result Bela Image will be updated more often and it minimizes future development effort. Goals . In order to add the Bela Image builder features to BeagleBoard Image builder. Firstly, I’ll be building Bela Image by using BeagleBoard Image builder scripts and making necessary changes in scripts to build Image. After this I will be getting a clear idea to where to change and semantic rebase the features of Bela Image builder to BeagleBoard Image builder one. Benefit . This project adds support for the Bela Image development to make Bela Image follow more closely with BeagleBoard Images. I mean after Bela specific changes made conditional to the Image-builder repository. The Bela Image development will be updated more often, more easily in parallel with BeagleBoard Images. ",

Tried with including bela-image-builder parameters for debootstrap in omap-image-builder scripts though it showed same error. | Much time was spent on debootstrap trying to figure where it’s coming from and it fixed with Robert Nelson help. | Solution: There’s a sed script that reads *.conf file, it’s currently only knows about &lt;tabs&gt; but yeah, it was always tabs and it’s more about more than one space sed 's/ /,/g' | bela.io-debian-bullseye-v4.14-ti-xenomai-armhf build completes all the way and ready for boot testing and figured out what packages broke and then moved that packages under “deb_addition_pkgs” in bela-bullseye conf file. | Studied about Debian Live Manual/Customizing Contents | Experimented on different ideas that which is suitable method for cross-compiling xenomai-3 for Bela with omap-image-builder including in /target/chroot script or chroot_before_hook in /configs bela-bullseye file. | Updated the target/chroot script (bela.io-bullseye.sh) with installation scripts to repos that bela ships and removed the ones that were not required for bela. | And, also spent some time on understanding Jenkins build systems as every git commit of omap-image-builder get’s built and a full log is available, So it’s quick to see if something broke and it just as a validate/helper. | bela-bullseye Image build logs can be seen here | . Accomplishments . | Built bela-bullseye Image with omap-image-builder scripts . | Added package list of what currently bela ships [PR #199] | bela-bullseye-image-build [PR #200] | Figured out what packages failed to install via debootstrap and made necessary changes [PR #201] | Modified bela-bullseye chroot script [PR #202] | Quick-wiki: Present workflow to build a Bela Image would look like | . | Tested the built bela-bullseye Image . | Flash and booted the Image | Installed Xenomai Kernel and Libraries, am335x PRU package, seasocks | . | .

See what that does and what file it uses) | see whether it can “inject” some of these changes in the upstream version or whether we should be maintaining a “forked” version | . | /lib/systemd/system/bela_flash_emmc.service and /opt/Bela/bela_flash_emmc.sh has similar problems. | .
