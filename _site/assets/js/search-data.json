    "content": ". | ARM Cross-Compilation on Debian x86 Machine | Find SD card device name | . Quick-wiki: ARM Cross-Compilation on Debian x86 Machine . The latest versions of DebianDebian has excellent support for cross-building through Debian Cross-toolchains ( see wiki: https://wiki.debian.org/ToolChain/Cross ). Toolchains are set of software development tools and libraries (such as gcc , gdb , glibc ) that are chained together to enable you to build executable code on one operating system on one type of machine, such as a 64-bit Linux OS on an Intel x86 machine, but to execute them on a different operating system and/or a different architecture, such as a 32-bit Linux OS on an ARM device. Debian cross toolchain is a good starting point. We can list the available toolchains as follows: . prashanth@krv:~$ apt-cache search cross-build-essential crossbuild-essential-amd64 - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-arm64 - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-armel - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-armhf - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-i386 - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-powerpc - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-ppc64el - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-s390x - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-mips - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-mips64 - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-mips64el - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-mips64r6 - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-mips64r6el - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-mipsel - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-mipsr6 - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages crossbuild-essential-mipsr6el - Informational list of cross-build-essential packages . The main purpose of these packages is to allow cross-compiling of Linux programs for different architecture distributions, but these can be used also for bare metal programming. One thing to be aware is the fact that the compiler by default tries to link the Linux standard C libraries that in bare metal programming have no use. Here, I’m using ARM hard float ( armhf ) package for writing programs that is deployed to the Beagle boards. prashanth@krv:~$ sudo apt install crossbuild-essential-armhf Preparing to unpack .../crossbuild-essential-armhf_12.9_all.deb ... Unpacking crossbuild-essential-armhf (12.9) ... Setting up crossbuild-essential-armhf (12.9) ... Test installation by calling the compiler directly. prashanth@krv:~$ arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++ -v COLLECT_GCC=arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++ Thread model: posix gcc version 10.2.1 20210110 (Debian 10.2.1-6) . I’m writing a short C++ program, testcross.cpp , which can be compiled into binary code using the cross-compiler. prashanth@krv:~$ gedit testcross.cpp prashanth@krv:~$ more testcross.cpp #include&lt;iostream&gt; using namespace std; int main(){ cout &lt;&lt; \"Testing cross compilation for armhf\" &lt;&lt; endl; return 0; } prashanth@krv:~$ arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++ testcross.cpp -o testcross prashanth@krv:~$ ls -l testcross* -rwxr-xr-x 1 prashanth prashanth 9064 Apr 5 13:02 testcross -rw-r--r-- 1 prashanth prashanth 119 Apr 5 13:00 testcross.cpp . The binary file has an executable flag, but when the binary is invoked, it fails to execute. This is unsurprising, as we are attempting to execute ARM binary instructions on an Intel x86 machine. prashanth@krv:~$ ./testcross arm-binfmt-P: Could not open '/lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3': No such file or directory . This error indicates that the ld-linux-armhf.so.3 file is not in the system library directory. A search of the filesystem locates it in the /usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf/lib/ directory. prashanth@krv:~$ stat /usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf/lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3 File: /usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf/lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3 -&gt; ld-2.31.so Size: 10 Blocks: 0 IO Block: 4096 symbolic link Device: b302h/45826d Inode: 1447823 Links: 1 Access: (0777/lrwxrwxrwx) Uid: ( 0/ root) Gid: ( 0/ root) Access: 2022-04-05 13:02:21.727259593 +0530 Modify: 2021-03-03 17:24:20.000000000 +0530 Change: 2022-03-29 20:49:01.659052574 +0530 Birth: 2022-03-29 20:49:01.631052872 +0530 . One approach to solve this issue is to explicitly call the QEMU tool and specify the library directory, whereupon the program is emulated correctly. prashanth@krv:~$ qemu-arm-static -L /usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf/ testcross Testing cross compilation for armhf . Success! If we see this output, then we are able to build a binary on the x86 machine that can be executed directly on the ARM machine. Find SD card device name . The SD card is an essential part of the Embedded Linux Systems. It’s often necessary to copy(or “flash”) the software from our machine to an SD card for use in Embedded Linux System, or to back up projects ot the entire contents of SD card. This guide is about to find the SD card’s device name! choosing the wrong drive will likely result in data loss or even worse harm to our machine. My machine has an Integrated SD card reader and it is connected by a multiport USB unit and will be presented as /dev/sdx, where X is a single letter. The first hard drive is often /dev/sda. In most of the machines with SD card slots, this wiil be often be /dev/mmcblk0. I find the following method to be handy and simple: . Step1: Open a terminal . Step2: Get the list of existing devices in our system into a temporary file (say, /tmp/before_sd): . prashanth@krv:~$ ls /dev &gt; /tmp/before_sd . Step3: Insert SD card (be it via an external reader or directly to the SD port of your computer) . Step4: Get again the list of devices into a second temporary file (say, /tmp/after_sd): . prashanth@krv:~$ ls /dev &gt; /tmp/after_sd . Step5: Compare them . prashanth@krv:~$ diff /tmp/before_sd /tmp/after_sd 36a37,39 &gt; mmcblk0 &gt; mmcblk0p1 &gt; mmcblk0p2 . Or, if the device follows sdX, it would be: . prashanth@krv:~$ diff /tmp/before_sd /tmp/after_sd 55a57,59 &gt; sda &gt; sda1 . Note: The topmost name we received - In my case, sda. That’s the device we want to write to! (the other devices will point to partitions within the media we inserted). ",

    "content": "Bela is an open hardware hardware and software platform for creating beautiful interaction with sensors, sound and it is designed for artists, musicians, researchers and makers, Bela brings the power of ultra-low latency interactive audio and sensors to digital systems. Bela Platform uses the Bela software which is a customised Debian distribution including a custom xenomai kernel, minimal clutter, and custom systemd configurations and It takes advantage of features of the BeagleBone computers and can achieve extremely fast audio and sensor processing times. Why Bela Image has been built again? . The Bela Image development repo is heavily based and which was initially inspired by Beagleboard Image-builder scripts. Currently, the Beagle board Image development repo diverged greatly from a common functionalities of building Images. And, there is an requirement to “rebase” the functionalities of the Bela Image builder repo to the Beagleboard Image builder one. As the two codebases are drastically different and need to rebuild the Bela Image and add the features of the Bela Image builder repo (xenomai kernel building scripts along with a bunch of Bela core) to Beagleboard Image builder repo. Now, after the specific changes the Bela Image development is following more closely with the Beagleboard Image development and as a result from now the Bela Image will be updated more often and it minimized further development effort. Project Preview . The main goal is to Improve the maintainability of the Bela Image development by adding the functionalities of the Bela Image builder repo to the BeagleBoard Image builder repo. Note: This project isn’t rewrite omap-image-builder with bela changes, it’s merge bela changes into omap-image-builder. Bela Image builds with RobertCNelson/omap-image-builder scripts, These are the same build scripts that were used to generate the official BeagleBoard Images, found here: https://beagleboard.org/latest-images . Bela - Build-Script Instructions . These scripts are tested on Debian x86 machine. A typical workflow to build a Bela Image would look like: . | Download RobertCNelson/omap-image-builder . git clone https://github.com/RobertCNelson/omap-image-builder cd ./omap-image-builder . | Generate: Debian root file system . | .

After the script finishes running, we will have an image file generated.
